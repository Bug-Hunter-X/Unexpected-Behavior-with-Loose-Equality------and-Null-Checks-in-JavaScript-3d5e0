# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to the loose equality operator (==) when dealing with null or undefined values.

## The Problem

The loose equality operator (==) in JavaScript performs type coercion before comparison.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when checking for null or undefined, as 0 is considered loosely equal to null and undefined. This often leads to incorrect handling of null values.

## The Solution

Always use the strict equality operator (===) when checking for null or undefined.  The strict equality operator does not perform type coercion, ensuring that comparisons are accurate and predictable.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the code demonstrating the issue.
3. Run `bug.js` in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js).
4. Observe the unexpected results.
5. Open `bugSolution.js` to see the code corrected using strict equality.
6. Run `bugSolution.js` to see the intended behavior.

## Learning Points

*   Always favor strict equality (===) over loose equality (==) in JavaScript, especially when handling null or undefined values to avoid unexpected type coercion behaviors.
